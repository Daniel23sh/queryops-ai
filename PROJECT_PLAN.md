# QueryOps AI — Project Plan

## Current Status

Active milestone: **M10 — Product Reliability & V1 Completion**. The target is a
reliable, complete **local IT Operations V1 using synthetic data**. Shared or
production deployment, real identity integration, additional domains and new
major capabilities are separate future scope.

**W0 is complete.** [PR #61](https://github.com/Daniel23sh/queryops-ai/pull/61)
integrated bounded-result evidence with focused correctness, metadata and consumer
corrections. Runtime baseline on `main`: `f23099c1a7d9ffaad8bc2c445a6551d77ffa5cb1`;
reviewed feature head: `a3759d8`. Documentation-only reconciliation follows that
runtime baseline. The original `2d7796c` is recoverable locally and remotely at
`codex/archive-m9-bounded-result-2d7796c`. The feature branch has been removed after
integration; no shared history was rewritten.

The modular architecture, plan-only provider, deterministic SQL, PostgreSQL RLS,
explicit scopes and governed actions remain the design. The
[October audit](docs/audits/2026-10-26-project-audit-he.md) is dated diagnostic
evidence, not release qualification. V1 remains **incomplete and unreleased**.

## Active Objective and Approved Scope

**W1 + W2 are merged.** [PR #63](https://github.com/Daniel23sh/queryops-ai/pull/63)
merged at `8cb9c8d55921454337316fb2e1ef9b8be4a6b1a2`. Its reviewed implementation
and passing deterministic CI are recorded in
[development history](docs/history/development-history.md); this is not V1 release
qualification.

**W2a + W3 are merged.** [PR #64](https://github.com/Daniel23sh/queryops-ai/pull/64)
merged at `e20fa7c9193efdb7ab5de6b01a80a3f39b4e30d3`. Its reviewed implementation
and passing deterministic CI are recorded in development history. This remains
implementation evidence, not V1 release qualification.

**W4 + W5 are merged.** [PR #65](https://github.com/Daniel23sh/queryops-ai/pull/65)
merged at `b1f03a4790c7569f7da0ef8d9be57ddd6da023c5`. Reviewed implementations,
independent findings/corrections and deterministic evidence are recorded in
[development history](docs/history/development-history.md). V1 remains unreleased.

**W6a diagnosis is complete on its review branch**, approved on 2026-11-01.
[PR #66](https://github.com/Daniel23sh/queryops-ai/pull/66) is open and intentionally
unmerged, from `investigation/m10-w6a-semantic-diagnosis` on verified main `b1f03a4`.
The [Hebrew diagnostic report](docs/audits/2026-11-01-w6a-semantic-diagnosis-he.md)
freezes source/data/catalog/runtime identities and separates candidate availability,
historical/current-unverified provider interpretation, supported encodings,
deterministic delivery and evaluator proof. Production behavior, tests, frozen
datasets, prompts and release gates are unchanged; no paid call was made.

Three diagnostic specialists, coordinator replays and a fresh non-author review
are complete. Two diagnostic reproducibility issues were corrected and re-reviewed
at `b1852b8`; no unresolved blocking review finding remains. Detailed evidence and
limitations are in the report/history. This does not qualify V1 or establish
current live-model quality.

The first proposed W6b correction is **deterministic output identity**: joined
fields with duplicate labels can lose a required value during JSON mapping.
Candidate/context coverage remains a separate next decision; broad algebra or
prompt/model changes are not established remedies. **W6b is not approved**.

## Constraints and Remaining Work

- Follow the [M10 roadmap](docs/development/m10-completion-roadmap.md) for W6a–W9
  dependencies/acceptance; W10 cleanup is optional. W6a diagnosis, W6b targeted
  correction and W6c independent validation are separate packages.
- Old environment v1/missing-fingerprint evidence cannot qualify under environment
  v2. Semantic diagnosis is complete in the unmerged PR; correction and independent validation,
  explicit local auth boundary, reproducible validation and final V1 QA remain open.
  The audit's hard-004 case passed its diagnostic canary; blanket historical
  failure claims are not accepted without new evidence.
- Preserve authorization, RLS, safety caps, historical V1 baselines, semantic
  correctness and thresholds. No result-driven dataset tuning or new major scope.
- Mock remains the default. No qualifying live evidence exists for this baseline;
  W5 identity and all release prerequisites must be complete before a separately
  authorized exact-model/run canary/full sequence. Full manual QA remains open.
- Never use user databases for destructive validation. Preserve unrelated changes
  and protect unique work before any destructive Git operation.

## Next Approved Work

Owner review of W6a PR #66 only; keep it **unmerged** until separately approved.
No new implementation is approved. The next decision is the narrow W6b output-
identity proposal and its acceptance criteria. Any live experiment also requires
separate exact-model/case/call-budget approval; do not begin later packages.
